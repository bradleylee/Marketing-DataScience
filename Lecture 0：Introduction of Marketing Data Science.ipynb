    "As marketing data scientists, we must speak\tthe\t**language of business**—*accounting, finance, marketing, and management*. We need to know about *information technology*, including *data structures*, *algorithms*, and *object-oriented programming*. We must understand *statistical modeling*,\t*machine learning*, *mathematical programming*,\tand\t*simulation\tmethods*. These are the things that we do:\t\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Information search**.\tWe begin by\tlearning what others have done before, learning from the literature. We draw on the work of academics and practitioners in many fields of study, contributors to predictive analytics and data science.\t\n",
    "+ **Preparing text and data**. Text is unstructured or partially structured data that must be prepared for analysis. We extract features from text.\tWe define measures.\tQuantitative data are often\tmessy or missing. They may require transformation prior to analysis. Data preparation consumes much of a data scientist’s time.\t\n",

    "+ **Testing\tit\tout**.\tWe examine\tmodels with diagnostic\tgraphics. We see how well a\tmodel developed\ton one data\tset\tworks on other\tdata sets. We employ a training-and-test regimen with data\tpartitioning, cross-validation,\tor\tbootstrap methods.\t\n",
    "+ **Playing\twhat-if**.\tWe\tmanipulate key\tvariables to see what happens to our predictions. We play what-if games\tin simulated marketplaces. We employ sensitivity or\tstress testing\tof mathematical\tprogramming\tmodels.\tWe see\thow\tvalues of input variables\taffect outcomes, payoffs, and predictions. We assess uncertainty about forecasts.\t\n",
    "+ **Explaining\tit\tall**.\tData and models\thelp us\tunderstand the\tworld.\tWe turn\twhat we\thave learned into an explanation that others\tcan\tunderstand.\tWe present project results in a\tclear and concise\tmanner. \n",

Data scientists convert the results of predictive models into simple,\tstraightforward\tlanguage that others can understand. Data scientists\tare\tknowledge workers\tpar\texcellence.\tThey are communicators playing a critical role in today’s data-intensive world.\tData scientists\tturn data into models and models into plans\tfor\taction. \n",

Within the statistical\tliterature,\tSeymour\tGeisser\tintroduced\tan\tapproach best described\tas Bayesian\tpredictive\tinference.\tIn\temphasizing\tthe\tsuccess\tof\tpredictions\tin marketing data science, we are in agreement with\tGeisser.
